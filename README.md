# TrueTone - Seasonal Colour Analysis Asssistant

## About
Hello! Welcome to the GitHub repository for TrueTone, my final year engineering project at Queen Mary University of London.

TrueTone is a mobile app designed to bring seasonal colour analysis to your fingertips, no expensive consultations and no need to fly to Korea! This app is aimed for Gen Z fashion lovers to help make wardrobe choices by identifying which colours truly complement their natural tones.

This project is built using React Native (Expo), ensuring a smooth experience on both iOS and Android devices. It combines UX research, user surveys, and interviews to ensure that the app looks and feels right for the people who will actually use it!

If you’re curious about personal colour analysis or frustrated with stylist apps that just don’t get it, I hope this project resonates with you.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements or just enjoy the app :)
